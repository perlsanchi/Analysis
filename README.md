Exploratory Data Analysis  (EDA) is the process of exploring, investigating and gathering insights from data using statistical measures and visualizations. The objective of EDA is to develop and understanding of data, by uncovering trends, relationships and patterns.

Found 2 datasets where one consists of actual dataset and another one is schema.
The main dataset consists of Column names with short code of Questions. The brief Questions for this code has been recorded in schema dataset. Analysing the schema, the most relevant codes are taken from this entire dataset and a new data has been created.
